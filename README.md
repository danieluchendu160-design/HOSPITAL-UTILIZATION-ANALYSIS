# HOSPITAL-UTILIZATION-ANALYSIS
## Project overview
Hospital utilization analysis using healthcare data to assess admissions, length of stay , and departmental efficiency through dashboards and KPIs
## Data Sources
This dashboard outlines the key analytical areas and performance indicators derived from the public hospital utilization dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding patients flow, service demand, hospital performance and heathcare outcome

## Tools
- .Microsoft Excel
  - Used for data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization
  - ## Exploratory Data Analysis
  - EDA was performed to understand patients admissions, department activity, and hospital afficiency before building dashboards and KPIs
  ## Data Analysis
  - The hospital utilization project analyzed patients admission, department activity,and hospital efficiency to identify trends, performance gaps,and high-demand areas
  ## Patients Admissions
  - Total admissions were calculated for each hospital, department, state, and month
  - Pediatrics, surgery, and emergency were identified as the most utilized departments
  - Admissions showed monthly variations, with peaks during certain months reflecting seasonal demand
  ## Trends And Patterns
  - Seasonal and monthly trends in patient admissions were visualized to understand workflow peaks
  - Outliers, such as unusually long stays, were investigated to identify inefficiencies
  - Comparative ananlysis between hospitals highlighted differences in efficiency and utilization
## Visual Analysis
- line chart for total admission by months
- Bar chart for admission by department, state, department
- Pie chart for admission by gender
- Column chart for mortality counts, admitted versus discharged patients, and average stay days
## Result/Findings
- Total admitted patients
- Total discharged patients
- Overall mortality rate
- Average length of stay
- Discharged rate
- Most utilized department
- Top performing hospital by admissions
- State with highest hospital utilization
